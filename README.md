# SYSTEM-ANALYSIS-AND-PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-Covid19-Vaccination-in-Dallas-PANVAC


Subject: Development of the Integrated Registration of Covid-19 vaccine in the city of Dallas

Purpose:
As plans are being made to extend vaccination to the general public after the more prioritized 
section, and keeping in mind the difficulties faced in the Phase 1, we are proposing the 
development of a unified registration and tracking system for Covid-19 vaccination in the city of 
Dallas named “PanVac”. This will provide the best and easy to use system for residents to get 
vaccinated without much delay.

Product:

Scope: 
The new registration system can bring together all the counties in the city of Dallas, so that
the vaccines can be made available to all hubs according to the registration data. We can expand 
the scope of the project to capture the supply chain details of the vaccinations to help with the 
procurement and distribution to accomplish the rapid vaccination of the general population.
Advantages: Our system provides an all in one dashboard for the city of Dallas to carry through 
the Covid-19 vaccination of the residents. This will be the one portal where residents can register,
check their waitlist status, and city health administrators can track availability of vaccines’ doses 
in each hub.

Departments: 
We will be managing the IT Department. We need assistance in getting the 
requirements from the Health Department.

Timeline & Next steps:
We have already formed a team for the project and have completed the preliminary 
requirements analysis for the system. We will complete the full requirements analysis in one 
week provided we will be getting the assistance from the city health department. We are 
estimating four weeks for completing designing, coding, and testing phases of the system 
considering the urgency of the situation. We can assure that we will be able to deliver and 
implement the system in 6 weeks. On successful execution, we can administer it in multiple cities 
across Texas without any impediment.
